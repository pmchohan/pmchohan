### Hey folks, Assalam-u-Alaikum ðŸ‘‹

This is Abdullah Faisal, currently enrolled in BS (AI) at University of Management and Technology, Lahore.

I have always had interest in computers and modern tech since i was a kid. Thats why from matric to higher education i have kept consistency. As AI is booming in this era I have developed interest in Computer Vision and Generative AI.

You might have heard that there are two types of people "Picasso" or "Einstein", well I am more on Einstein side. I love solving problems using logic, which I think helps not just with coding but with life in general.

I'm good at using C++ and Python. I started with C++ and now I'm learning a lot about AI with Python.

Talking about university's life, I am a part of AI/ML team of GDSC UMT and President of my Block from Leader's Forum.
Recently i have grown interest in competitive programming as well.

Now a days I am trying to learn new stuff and help my juniors with the guidance which i think i lacked when i started.
