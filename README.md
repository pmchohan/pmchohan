### Hey folks, Assalam-u-Alaikum 👋

I’m **Abdullah Faisal**—an AI & backend enthusiast who loves turning ideas into working products. I’m more on the *“Einstein”* side of the spectrum: I enjoy solving problems with logic, which helps with code (and life) just as much.

I started with **C++**, and these days I build most of my AI work in **Python**. I’m especially interested in **Generative AI** and **Computer Vision**. I’ve also been active in the tech community—previously part of the **GDSC UMT AI/ML team** and a **Block President** in the Leaders’ Forum. Lately, I’ve picked up an interest in **competitive programming**.

I’m always learning new stuff and sharing what I know with juniors—the kind of guidance I wish I’d had when starting out.

#### What I’m exploring

* 🌱 NLP, Computer Vision, JavaScript
* 💡 GenAI apps and practical ML features

#### Tech I use

* **Python**, **C++**, **Node.js**
